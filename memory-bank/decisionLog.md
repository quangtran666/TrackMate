# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-08-05 15:41:43 - Memory Bank initialization completed. Project architecture analysis documented.

## Decision

**Technology Stack Selection**

**Rationale**: The project uses a modern, scalable technology stack chosen for performance, developer experience, and community support. React Native provides cross-platform mobile development capabilities, while Go offers excellent performance for backend services.

**Implementation Details**:
- Frontend: React Native with Expo for rapid development and deployment
- Backend: Go with Gin framework for high-performance API services
- Database: MongoDB for flexible data storage and scalability
- Authentication: Auth0 for secure, managed authentication
- UI: Gluestack UI components with TailwindCSS for consistent styling
- State Management: Zustand for client state, TanStack Query for server state

## Decision

**Architecture Pattern: Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design**

**Rationale**: Separation of concerns is maintained through clear architectural layers, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

**Implementation Details**:
- Domain layer: Contains business logic and entities
- Infrastructure layer: Database connections, external services
- Use case layer: Application-specific business rules
- Application layer: HTTP handlers and request/response handling
- Clear dependency inversion with interfaces

## Decision

**Memory Bank Implementation**

**Rationale**: Establishing a Memory Bank system to maintain project context, track decisions, and preserve knowledge across development sessions.

**Implementation Details**:
- Core files: productContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md
- Regular updates triggered by significant changes
- Cross-mode compatibility for consistent project tracking
